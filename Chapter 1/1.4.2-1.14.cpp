/* Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. 
 * Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form? 
 */
// 1.9: Creating an interative loop using for is more efficient and readable when compared with using while. 
// 1.10: Once again, 'for' wins outright. Engineering a for loop out of while is complicated and not apparent. 
// 1.11: Same comment. 
// For is best suited for iterative loops, whereas while is can be used for all loops based on a condition of any type.
